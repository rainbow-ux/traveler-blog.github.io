### The British Museum
Also known as the British Museum, it is located in Russell Square, north of New Oxford Street, London, UK. Founded in 1753, the British Museum is the oldest and most magnificent comprehensive museum in the world. It has collected many cultural relics and Book treasures from all over the world, which are rare in museums all over the world. The collection mainly came from Britain's expansion from the 18th century to the 19th century.

The cultural relics collected in the British Museum include the frescoes of Qingliang temple in Ming Dynasty, the three colored Arhats of Liao Dynasty, the blue and white vases of Yuan Dynasty, the Rosetta stone tablets engraved with ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, Egyptian cursive script and Greek more than 2200 years ago on the front, the head of Ramesses II, and the marble carvings of the Parthenon temple in Athens. Some of them are the only ones left in the world, which can only be seen in the British Museum. Among them, the Chinese Showroom (China Pavilion) accounts for several halls. Chinese cultural relics are regarded as one of the most important collections by the British Museum, with a total of more than 23000 pieces.

### 大英博物馆（ The British Museum）
又名不列颠博物馆，位于英国伦敦新牛津大街北面的罗素广场。大英博物馆成立于1753年，是世界上历史最悠久、规模最宏伟的综合性博物馆。它收藏了世界各地的许多文物和图书珍品，藏品之丰富、种类之繁多为全世界博物馆所罕见。藏品主要是英国于18世纪至19世纪英国对外扩张中得来。

### Westminster Abbey
Westminster Abbey is one of the most magnificent churches in the world. It has a grand and dignified appearance, exquisite decoration, and the whole building is resplendent and quiet. It is considered as a masterpiece of British Gothic architecture.

Westminster Abbey is one of the symbols of England. After the completion of the project, it undertook the coronation of the king, royal wedding, national funeral and other major ceremonies. Successive monarchs, as well as some great men, were buried in Westminster Abbey.

### 威斯敏斯特教堂
威斯敏斯特大教堂是世界上最巍峨壮丽的教堂之一，它的外观恢弘凝重，装潢优美精致，整座建筑金碧辉煌而又静谧肃穆，被认为是英国哥特式建筑中的杰作。

威斯敏斯特教堂可以说是英国的象征之一。建成后承办了国王加冕，皇家婚礼、国葬等重大仪式。历任君主，以及一些伟人都葬在威斯敏斯特教堂。

### London Tower Bridge
The tower bridge of London, which crosses the Thames River, is named because it is near the tower of London. It is the first bridge calculated from the Thames estuary (15 bridges are built on the Thames River). Therefore, it has the reputation of "the gate of London" and is also a symbol of London. The bridge was first built in 1886 and opened to the public in 1894, connecting the north and south of London.

London Tower Bridge brings people not only the convenience of traffic, but also the visual beauty. It is not so much a bridge connecting the north and south of London as a carrier of architectural art.            

The tower bridge of London is not only the gate of London, but also the watchtower of London. Standing on the 43.455-meter tower bridge of London, you can have a panoramic view of both sides of the Thames, and you can also have a panoramic view of the fence, especially in the evening. 
### 塔桥
伦敦塔桥，横跨泰晤士河，因在伦敦塔附近而得名，是从泰晤士河口算起的第一座桥（泰晤士河上共建桥15座），所以有“伦敦之门”的美称，也是伦敦的象征。该桥始建于1886年，1894年对公众开放，将伦敦南北区连接成整体。

伦敦塔桥带给我们的不仅是通行上的方便，还有视觉上的美感。与其说它是连接伦敦南北区的一座桥，不如说它是建筑艺术的载体。

伦敦塔桥不但是伦敦的大门，还是伦敦的眺望台。站在43.455米的伦敦塔桥上，极目远眺，可以饱览泰晤士河两岸的风光，你也可以凭栏远望，尤其是傍晚，美丽的伦敦夜色尽收眼底。
