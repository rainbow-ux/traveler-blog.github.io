### The British Museum
Also known as the British Museum, it is located in Russell Square, north of New Oxford Street, London, UK. Founded in 1753, the British Museum is the oldest and most magnificent comprehensive museum in the world. It has collected many cultural relics and Book treasures from all over the world, which are rare in museums all over the world. The collection mainly came from Britain's expansion from the 18th century to the 19th century.

The cultural relics collected in the British Museum include the frescoes of Qingliang temple in Ming Dynasty, the three colored Arhats of Liao Dynasty, the blue and white vases of Yuan Dynasty, the Rosetta stone tablets engraved with ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs, Egyptian cursive script and Greek more than 2200 years ago on the front, the head of Ramesses II, and the marble carvings of the Parthenon temple in Athens. Some of them are the only ones left in the world, which can only be seen in the British Museum. Among them, the Chinese Showroom (China Pavilion) accounts for several halls. Chinese cultural relics are regarded as one of the most important collections by the British Museum, with a total of more than 23000 pieces.
