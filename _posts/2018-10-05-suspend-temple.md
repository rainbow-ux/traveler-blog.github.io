If there is a temple built on a cliff 90 meters from the ground, and has been standing for 1400 years. Do you think this is a miracle in the history of human architecture?

Xuankong Temple, located in the west side of Jinlong gorge, Hengshan, Hunyuan County, Datong City, Shanxi Province, between the cliffs of Cuiping peak, because the whole temple is like hanging on a cliff, so it is named.

The hanging Temple of Hengshan is based on half inserted flying beams with mechanical principles. It skillfully borrows the hidden support of rocks, and the beams and columns are integrated together, and the corridors and railings are connected left and right. The twists and turns are extraordinary, and the real and the virtual are living together. There are more than 80 bronze, iron, stone and clay Buddha statues in the temple. The word "spectacular" on the rocks under the temple is the calligraphy of Li Bai, the poet of Tang Dynasty. The whole temple is of wooden frame structure. It is based on cutting holes on steep cliffs and inserting suspension beams. The pavilions are connected by plank roads, leaning on steep cliffs and facing deep valleys. The temple is not big, but it is also spectacular. The temple's location is dangerous, its architecture is strange, its structure is ingenious and its connotation is rich, which can be regarded as the best in the world. It is not only the national treasure of the Chinese nation, but also the precious cultural heritage of mankind.

When I visit the temple, I feel that the temple seems to fall down from the sky. I look up from the bottom of the mountain. I don't think it's a pavilion built on the hillside, but it's like a painter's hand splashing ink on the cliff, painted on the cliff, and an old picture hanging in front of you. I'm shocked by it. It can not only make people feel the uncanny workmanship of nature, but also praise the ancient people's wonderful skills and wisdom.

Xuankong Temple is not only breathtaking in appearance, strange and spectacular, but also has distinctive architectural structure and colorful forms. It not only integrates the art of Chinese garden architecture, but also integrates the pattern of Chinese traditional architecture.

如果有一座寺庙修建在距离地面90米高的悬崖上，并且一直屹立1400年不倒。你会认为这是一个人类建筑历史上的奇迹吗？

悬空寺，位于山西省大同市浑源县恒山金龙峡西侧翠屏峰峭壁间，因为整座寺院就像悬挂在悬崖上，因此得名。

恒山悬空寺利用力学原理半插飞梁为基，巧借岩石暗托，梁柱上下一体，廊栏左右相连，曲折出奇，虚实相生。寺内有铜、铁、石、泥佛像八十多尊，寺下岩石上“壮观”二字，是唐代诗仙李白的墨宝。全寺为木质框架式结构，在陡崖上凿洞插悬梁为基，楼阁间以栈道相通，背倚陡峭的绝壁，下临深谷，寺不大，但巧夺天工，也颇为壮观。悬空寺的选址之险，建筑之奇，结构之巧，丰富的内涵，堪称世界一绝。它不但是中华民族的国宝，也是人类的珍贵文化遗产。

我在游览悬空寺时，感觉悬空寺仿佛从天而降，从山下往上仰望悬空寺，不觉得是楼台亭阁建筑于半山腰，却似丹青妙手泼墨在岩壁，彩绘于山崖，一幅古老的画卷悬挂在你面前，心灵为之震撼。不由让人感慨大自然的鬼斧神工，更赞美古人巧夺天工的妙手、聪明睿智的匠心。

悬空寺不仅外貌惊险，奇特、壮观，建筑构造也颇具特色，形式丰富多彩，它既融合了中国园林建筑艺术，又不失中国传统建筑的格局。
